Release: 0.60 -

      . Rewrite of the shared resource management

        * Addition of a 'requiredCSS' method
        * New IWL::SnippetManager pseudo-root object, for use with html snippets
        * Javascript files are placed at the last possible moment
        * CSS files are placed as early as possible
        * 'iwl:independant' attribute for scripts, if they don't require any shared resources
        * Multiple shared resources are obtained in one request, if a 'STATIC_URI_SCRIPT' is in use
      . Javascript:
        * document.insertScript is now part of 'base.js', requires IWL
	* Event.emitSignal can emit regular HTML events, such as 'change' or 'keydown'.
	    Options for these events (like 'bubbles', or 'ctrlKey') can be added to the
	    created event, by instantiating a new 'Event.Options' object, with the options
	    hash as the parameter of the constructor, and passing it as the last argument
	    of the emitSignal method.
