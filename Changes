        * Javascript files are placed at the last possible moment
        * CSS files are placed as early as possible
        * 'iwl:independant' attribute for scripts, if they don't require any shared resources

      . Javascript:

	* Event.emitSignal can emit regular HTML events, such as 'change' or 'keydown'.
	    Options for these events (like 'bubbles', or 'ctrlKey') can be added to the
	    created event, by instantiating a new 'Event.Options' object, with the options
	    hash as the parameter of the constructor, and passing it as the last argument
	    of the emitSignal method.
